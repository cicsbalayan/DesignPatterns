# Design Patterns

---

This repository focuses on the **Design Patterns** topic, which aims to provide developers with efficient and proven ways to build their software.  
The patterns are grouped into three main categories:

- **Creational** – Design patterns that simplify and standardize the process of creating objects, making code more flexible and reusable.
- **Structural** – Patterns that deal with the composition of classes and objects, ensuring designs are well-structured and easier to maintain.
- **Behavioral** – Patterns that define how objects interact, communicate, and control the program’s flow based on actions or behavior.
